# natebwilson's General Purpose Dotfile Repo

This is a repo to store my dotfiles (mainly to sync my nvim and .bashrc/.zshrc across my laptop/desktop), but also to store some utility/information (like passwords to overthewire's bandit).

This is pure utility. Nothing here should be considered impressive.
