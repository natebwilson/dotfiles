# natebwilson's General Purpose Dotfile Repo

This is a repo to store my dotfiles (mainly to sync my nvim and .bashrc/.zshrc across my laptop/desktop), but also to store some utility/information (like passwords to overthewire's bandit).

This is pure utility, and it's probably obvious I'm an amateur. I tried symlinking my WezTerm config (my preferred terminal emulator) from Windows into Linux so I could track it with a repo, but it's literally only stored as a path to a separate drive. Nobody's probably reading this anyways - oh well ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
